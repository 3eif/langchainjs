# Vectara

Vectara is an open source vector database that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering. LangChain connects to Vectara via the `Vectara-ts-client` package, the official Typescript client for Vectara.

LangChain inserts vectors directly to Vectara, and queries Vectara for the nearest neighbors of a given vector, so that you can use all the LangChain Embeddings integrations with Vectara.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install Vectara-ts-client graphql
```

You'll need to run Vectara either locally or on a server, see [the Vectara documentation](https://Vectara.io/developers/Vectara/installation) for more information.
