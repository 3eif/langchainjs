What is Vectara?

**Vectara Overview:**
- Vectara is developer-first API platform for building GenAI applications.
- To use Vectara - first [sign up](https://console.vectara.com/signup) and create an account. Then create a corpus and an API key for indexing and searching.
- You can use Vectara's [indexing API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/indexing-apis/indexing) to add documents into Vectara's index.
- You can use Vectara's [Search API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/search-apis/search) to query Vectara's index (which also supports Hybrid search implicitly).
- You can use Vectara's integration with LangChain as a Vector store or using the Retriever abstraction.

## Installation and Setup
To use Vectara with LangChainJS no special installation steps are required. 

These can be provided as environment variables or in a .env file:
- export `VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID`="your_customer_id"
- export `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID`="your_corpus_id"
- export `VECTARA_API_KEY`="your-vectara-api-key"

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

# Vectara Integration

Vectara provides both a SOTA optimized vector store and its own embeddings, so you don't have to compute embeddings directly within the chain.
The Vectara API is encapsulated in the VectorStore interface, but unlike external databases, TBD

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install Vectara-ts-client
```

## Usage, index documents

import InsertExample from "@examples/src/indexes/vector_stores/Vectara_fromTexts.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{InsertExample}</CodeBlock>

## Usage, query documents

import QueryExample from "@examples/src/indexes/vector_stores/Vectara_search.ts";
